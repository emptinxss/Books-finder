## Overview

This is the project I created from the **Javascript advanced Start2Impact's** guide.
You can find all the info [here](https://www.start2impact.it/percorsi/) about start2impact courses.

## Javascript Advanced

This project is all about working with API and manage the data.

You can practice:

- Implement webpack in your project

I used the [openlibrary API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api)
